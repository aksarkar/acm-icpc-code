Hello world!  Everyone should greet the entire world in a friendly
manner. Wouldn't that make the world a more friendly place?

From: The Wright Brothers' Aeroplane.

By Orville and Wilbur Wright

In the field of aviation there were two schools. The first,
represented by such men as Professor Langley and Sir Hiram Maxim,
gave chief attention to power flight; the second, represented by
Lilienthal, Mouillard, and Chanute, to soaring flight. Our sympathies
were with the latter school, partly from impatience at the wasteful
extravagance of mounting delicate and costly machinery on wings
which no one knew how to manage, and partly, no doubt, from the
extraordinary charm and enthusiasm with which the apostles of soaring
flight set forth the beauties of sailing through the air on fixed
wings, deriving the motive power from the wind itself.

We began our active experiments at the close of this period, in October,
1900, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Our machine was designed to be
flown as a kite, with a man on board, in winds from 15 to 20 miles an
hour. But, upon trial, it was found that much stronger winds were
required to lift it. Suitable winds not being plentiful, we found it
necessary, in order to test the new balancing system, to fly the machine
as a kite without a man on board, operating the levers through cords
from the ground. This did not give the practice anticipated, but it
inspired confidence in the new system of balance.

In the summer of 1901 we became personally acquainted with Mr. Chanute.
When he learned that we were interested in flying as a sport, and not
with any expectation of recovering the money we were expending on it, he
gave us much encouragement. At our invitation, he spent several weeks
with us at our camp at Kill Devil Hill, four miles south of Kitty Hawk,
during our experiments of that and the two succeeding years. He also
witnessed one flight of the power machine near Dayton, Ohio, in October,
1904.
